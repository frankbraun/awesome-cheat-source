Awesome Cheat Source
--------------------

Like an awesome list, but for cheat source.

**Cheat source is a cheat sheet which is runnable source code.**

### Rules of the game

-   One or maximally two files per language (e.g., `golang.go`,
    `html5.html`, `css3.css`, `erlang.erl`, and `c.c` & `c.h`).
-   Idiomatic code only.
-   Focus on common constructs, not on completeness.
-   Add comments in the cheat source.
-   Runnable code only (whatever "runnable" means for the language in
    question).

### Contents

-   [Go](golang.go)
